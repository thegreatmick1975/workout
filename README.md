# workout
My buddy and i decided hey lets be productive and build some stuff thats cool. So we did/are. I'm personally fascinated with the backend and he's going full stack.
I wrote a RESTapi using flask and a query file using flask that will show the output of the database table at http://localhost:5000/users
He is going to write all the front end code for a workout app included with a GUI using Winforms. 
I also supplied a HTTP request in C# which he can later tweak so everything will be intertwinded together. 
Cool stuff
